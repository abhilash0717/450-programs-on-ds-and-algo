Explanation:
Testcase 1: The minimum difference between maximum chocolates
and minimum chocolates is 9-3=6

/*
FIRSTLY THEY HAVE GIVEN AN ARRAY WHICH ARE CHILDREN WHICH ARE HAVING DIFFERNET NUMBER OF CANDIES
LETS STORE SOME BIG VALUE IN MIN_DIFF
NEXT THEY HAVE GIVEN THE VALUE M WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF KIDS V HAVE TO SELECT AT ONCE
WE NOW SORT THE ARRAY
IN FIRST ITERATION WE CONSIDER M KIDS AND FIND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE KIDS WHO IS HAVING MAX CANDIES AND WITH THE KID 
WHO IS HAVING MINIMUM CANDIES
WE THEN CHECK THIS DIFF WITH MIN_DIFF AND WE STORE THE MIN IN THESE TWO IN OUR ANSWER
AT THE END WE PRINT THE MIN_DIFF
EXAMPLE
8
3 4 1 9 56 7 9 12
5

SORTED ARRAY => 1 3 4 7 9 9 12 56
WE TAKE ELEMENTS BETWEEN ARRAY[I] AND ARRAY[I+M-1], HERE -1 IS BECAUSE WE NEED EXACTLY M KIDS NOT MORE THAN THAT
1st ITERATION --> 1 3 4 7 9 => DIFF = 8, Math.min(8,min_diff), min_diff = 8
2nd ITERATION --> 3 4 5 9 9 => DIFF = 6, Math.min(6,min_diff), min_diff = 6
3rd ITERATION --> 4 7 9 9 12 => DIFF = 8, Math.min(8,min_diff), min_diff = 6
4th ITERATION --> 7 9 9 12 56 => DIFF = 49, Math.min(49,min_diff), min_diff = 6
LASTLY WE PRINT THE MIN_DIFF WHICH IS 6 AND THE CORRECT ANSWER
